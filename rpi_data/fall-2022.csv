An essential part of this course is to stimulate students’ curiosity about architecture and the larger world and introduce them to key issues of architecture regarding space, form, critique, technology, aesthetics, societal and cultural contexts, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to the emergence of modernism in architecture. Crucial to the goals of this course is to encourage students to pursue and develop their own unique vision and voice in architecture throughout their education and practice.

The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure.
