The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability. Consequences of resource extraction, distribution, manipulation, use, and disposal, reuse or recycle are addressed at both local and global scales.

        "description": "Architecture and painting are two of the oldest forms of societal expression and have been historically linked in complex and dynamic ways. In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course.",

An essential part of this course is to stimulate students' curiosity about architecture and the larger world and introduce them to key issues of architecture regarding space, form, critique, technology, aesthetics, societal and cultural contexts, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to the emergence of modernism in architecture. Crucial to the goals of this course is to encourage students to pursue and develop their own unique vision and voice in architecture throughout their education and practice. Fundamental to this process is making students aware of the necessity to challenge their own subjectivities, biases, and presuppositions.",

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: the following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life and life cycle cost.

What are the economic, cultural, and technological implications/impacts of/on a given data policy? How would one even go about understanding and evaluating a data policy?

To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society. Credit cannot be obtained for both IHSS 1200 and ECON 1200",

This course will apply fundamental economic concepts, such as supply and demand, competition, monopoly, externalities, and Pareto efficiency to a range of legal topics, including contracts, torts, criminal, and intellectual property law to explain the economic motivation and consequences of the legal framework. For those students considering law school, this course offers an exposure to many of the legal concepts found in the first year law school curriculum.",

        "description": "In order to survive, corporations need to renew themselves. This requires instilling an entrepreneurial mindset which is often a challenge for large established corporations. Corporations caught up in the web of commoditization, stagnation, down-sizing, cost-cutting, re-engineering and the fast pace of globalization and technical change have come to realize that boosting their entrepreneurial capabilities, can improve their competitive positions through creating new markets and even transforming their industries. Yet overall, these efforts have produced uneven success. Although entrepreneurs in organizations can benefit from the knowledge resources, experience, and financial assets and networks of the large firm, they are constrained by the firm's inertial structure and entrenched management practices, as well as by the influence of current customers. This course helps students understand these challenges and how to cope with them through developing appropriate corporate competencies, structures, systems, and talent management practices.",

        "description": "Cognitive modeling investigates human cognition by developing computational systems that simulate cognitive processes. Cognitive modeling grew out of Cognitive Psychology and Artificial Intelligence. Cognitive models are used in a number of basic and applied domains including Human-Computer Interaction, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Computer-Generated Forces, and Synthetic Characters. In this course, students will develop models in ACT-R (a unified theory of cognition) that simulate recent findings in cognitive psychology.",

        "description": "This seminar course is a detailed examination of the mind-brain relationship, through study of the stress response. Stress is simply defined as any challenge to an individual's homeostasis, or balance. This course will explore the neurobiological underpinnings of the stress response, with particular focus on how stressors can alter perception, affective and cognitive processing in the individual, which can in turn feedback to alter the general health of the individual (body and mind/brain).",
