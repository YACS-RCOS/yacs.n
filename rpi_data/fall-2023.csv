An essential part of this course is to stimulate students’ curiosity about architecture and the larger world and introduce them to key issues of architecture regarding space, form, critique, technology, aesthetics, societal and cultural contexts, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to the emergence of modernism in architecture. Crucial to the goals of this course is to encourage students to pursue and develop their own unique vision and voice in architecture throughout their education and practice. Fundamental to this process is making students aware of the necessity to challenge their own subjectivities, biases, and presuppositions.",,,[],[],Architecture

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student’s access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

Furthermore, biocatalysis has become a primary tool to develop sustainable pathways for chemical manufacturing. Students are introduced to basic biochemical principles of enzymes and whole cell systems. Lectures on free enzymes discuss their catalytic mechanism(s), approaches to enable their practical use under non-aqueous conditions (e.g., immobilization on solid supports), effects of reaction media polarity and water content.  The importance of protein and metabolic engineering to developing practical biocatalysts is discussed. Integrated within the course are discussions of green chemistry and sustainability.",,,[],[],Science
