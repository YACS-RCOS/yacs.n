The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

The theoretical concepts covered in the introduction course form the conceptual basis for work in Structures 2, with relevant new concepts/techniques covered. Innovative, non-normative structural systems are investigated and discussed. Analysis and design will proceed using primarily computer-aided techniques. The course approach will involve in-class presentations, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: structural robustness, and programmatic flexibility.

The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure.

Research design includes: (1) identifying and selecting focused research problems/opportunities/ideas; (2) documenting the state of the art in the selected research area; (3) identifying the critical resources and settings to carry out the research; (4) designing the research program including strategies and tactics for carrying out the research. It is hoped that the knowledge gained in the RD Seminar will assist students in the development of their own individual thesis proposals while they contribute to active research.

The first part (the Fall semester) will be focused on hands-on research tools and techniques. First, students will learn the basics of digital signal processing, develop an understanding of measurement equipment and analysis methods for sound. The course will examine the ISO standards of room-acoustic measurements, develop students' research goals and a specific set of data to gather for their research. The course will also prepare the students with the fundamental knowledge on CATT Acoustic and/or EASE in geometrical modeling. Then the students and professors will visit a number of performance venues (e.g. EMPAC Concert Hall, and/ or other venues) and perform the room-acoustic measurements. Students will then work on analyzing and interpreting the research results. Practice measurements will be scheduled in the gallery or somewhere on campus before trips to performance halls. MATLAB will play a central role throughout all the classes (SRL I & II) and the thesis research projects. It will be used during the class exercises. Within one week from the semester start, every student is required to INSTALL a functioning MATLAB Software package onto her/his laptop computer.B.S. and B.
