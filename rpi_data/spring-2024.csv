A new and progressively more complex topic is introduced each week, and each topic is presented with an associated design exercise. This course is taught in a seminar format with some instructor led tutorials and workshop content linked to dedicated breakout time for completing assignments and modeling.

However, the vulnerabilities and privacy risks of ML models could put public safety and user privacy in danger. Existing studies have shown that the ML applications such as financial analytics and autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to attacks that can manipulate the models to their malicious ends. This course will introduce potential vulnerabilities of ML models, recent research and future directions about the security and privacy problems in real-world machine learning systems. We will cover different types of attacks against computer systems leveraging ML as well as defense techniques, privacy-preserving ML, and robustness and fairness in ML.
