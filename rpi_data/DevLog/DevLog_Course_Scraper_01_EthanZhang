Issue:

I was looking into building a Rate My Professors display for the yacs calendar
but I noticed that the professor names are incorrectly formatted due to the
site that the scraper is taking information from (https://sis.rpi.edu/reg/zfs202209.htm). 

This affects the UI as well since courses with multiple professors listed (prof1/prof2/prof3)
tend to have names cut off.

The site that I believe is used by quacs for their course information scraper is directly through
the sis portal which accurately includes the full names of the professors. I think the issue with
this is the info is locked behind sis login as opposed to the previous link which is an unlocked
site.
