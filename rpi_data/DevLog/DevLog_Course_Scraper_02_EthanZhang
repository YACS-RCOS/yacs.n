Created 2 python files one in the db directory and one in the table directory.

One of the programs (rmp.py in db directory) is able to create a json file 
containing all the professor information scraped from the RPI rate my 
professors site.

Attempting to copy prexisting methods of parsing from csv files and translating
the structure to work with the rmp.json file. Hopefully populating the database
will allow frontend code to access the rmp information to output onto the calendar.
