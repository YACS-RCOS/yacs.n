Students learn tools to navigate the intersection of environmental design and computational workflows by mastering parametric modeling and optimization for sustainability. Students gain proficiency in using parametric applications as both an analytical tool and a generative design device. The course exposes students to feedback loops between environmental analysis and design decision, fostering performance-based design strategies. Students explore the integration of parametric modeling with building energy modeling and bioclimatic analysis. Project based exercises are developed to address ecological design principles and optimize systems for multi-variable trade-offs. This course is designed for both graduate and undergraduate students seeking to advance their skills in environmentally-driven design through computational methods. By leveraging the course's resources and instructor's expertise, students develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between design choices and ecological impact. Environmental parametric is taught as a hybrid course, available online to students on campus and in person at the CASE center in New York City.

The theoretical concepts covered in the introductory course form the conceptual basis for work in Structures 2, with relevant new concepts/techniques covered. Students will explore load transfer in different structural assemblies and consider how seismic and other complex loading can impact architectural considerations. Innovative, non-normative structural systems are investigated and discussed. Design optimization approaches are introduced and explored as avenues to accomplish more optimum design conditions under increasingly strict design constraints. The course approach will involve in class presentations, homework, exams, worked problems, and case studies.

We will start by discussing the RL/control problem as it applies to autonomous systems. We will cover Markov decision processes, policy/value iteration, policy gradient methods, actor-critic, deep RL, as well as on-policy and off-policy learning. We will also discuss some supervised learning settings such as linear regression and deep learning, especially as they pertain to deep RL. Students taking this course will get exposure to image classification and several reinforcement learning benchmarks, such as mountain car and the inverted pendulum.","Prerequisites: CSCI 2300; an advanced 4000-level algorithms-based CSCI or MATH course; familiarity with probability, linear algebra, and calculus",,['CSCI 2300'],[],Science
