This repository contains the alternate template scraper originally written by Jun Simons in Spring 2023.

The output is not entirely formalized, but note the sections for multiple choice course selections.  
This data is not present in the previous version of the template scraper.

Note: all the scraping is done in one loop and one file, so any adjustments are made within.
