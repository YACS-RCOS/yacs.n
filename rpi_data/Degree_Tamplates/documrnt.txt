For the table I have done previously about the major comparing between YACS
and RPI Web is going to show how many majors YACS are missing compare to total
number of majors we have. From this research I find out several non-exist majors
and list them out so as to help other group members to add them on YACS later.
Plus, based on this research I also find out some majors on YACS such as ASTR
is actually not a formal degree that has been considered as major by RPI. In the
other hands. Some majors like BIO can actually seperated into several different
majors. I believe yacs could try to classify majors more exact and detailed in
the future which can help users to be more comfortable and convenient on using 
YACS.
