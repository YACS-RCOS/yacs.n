Students who apply Advanced Placement credits in place of BIOL 1010 may take BIOL 2120 in its place.
Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS) Core Electives: A total of 24 credits of HASS Core Electives should be taken. Students should take an Inquiry course during their first year. For a listing of HASS Inquiry courses go to: https://info.rpi.edu/hass-inquiry. In addition, students should take a HASS communication-intensive course during their first three semesters.
Culminating experience and curriculum specific communication-intensive course.
The courses for the fourth year are completed at Albany Medical College. These courses are transferred back to RPI to satisfy the requirements for the four-year degree. Additional coursework at AMC is required for the M.D. degree. Please note that during summer between year 3 and year 4, a 0-credit hour research experience is required at Albany Medical College and must be completed for the degree.
