Here is a list of known edges sectioned off based on the status of the specific problem (SOLVED, IN-PROGRESS, NOT STARTED)
------------------------------------------------
SOLVED:
- When checking for the <li> elements, we need to make sure that we account for certain variations of the "See footnote" text (e.g. some start with "[" some start with "("
- Stripped off extraneous course information
- Certain courses have an extra line that has repetitive information about course credit (e.g for civil engineering, STSO 4100 has an extra line saying "Credits/Units: 2")
- Resolving web scraping process for majors that do not last 4 years (e.g Architecture, Physician-Scientist) to add/remove any extra iterations
- There are certain links to certain majors programs page that do not show up in the majorURLlist.txt file (e.g Architecture)
- Redundant information in Arch Semester section for Music Major - This is the result of the outer row with the text "Choose one of the following:" as well as the inner rows containing 
    course names having the same HTML tag (<li>). The loop runs through adds the text of all <li> elements, so the courses show up twice
- Cognitive Science page has a separate format for courses with many subcategories of courses to choose from
------------------------------------------------
IN-PROGRESS:
- Computer and Systems Engineering and Electrical Engineering pages' 4th year category does not split the courses into semesters
- Sometimes, students have an option to choose one of two courses but the formatting differs from major to major (e.g. CS 4th Year Prog Lang and Design, Innovation, and Society and GSAS)
------------------------------------------------
NOT STARTED:
- There is an index-out-of-range error when converting the major information into a SQL command. This seems to be occurring with semesters for majors that do not separate their course into 2 semesters 
    (e.g Environmental Science has "3" semesters for its third year and Computer Systems and Engineering does not have any semesters listed at all.)
