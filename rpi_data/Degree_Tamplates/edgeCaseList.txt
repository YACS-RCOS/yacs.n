Here is a list of known edges sectioned off based on the status of the specific problem (SOLVED, IN-PROGRESS, NOT STARTED)
------------------------------------------------
SOLVED:
- When checking for the <li> elements, we need to make sure that we account for certain variations of the "See footnote" text (e.g. some start with "[" some start with "("
- Stripped off extraneous course information
------------------------------------------------
IN-PROGRESS:
- Resolving web scraping process for majors that do not last 4 years (e.g Architecture, Physician-Scientist) to add/remove any extra iterations
------------------------------------------------
NOT STARTED:
- Certain courses have an extra line that has repetitive information about course credit (e.g for civil engineering, STSO 4100 has an extra line saying "Credits/Units: 2")
- Cognitive Science page has a separate format for courses with many subcategories of courses to choose from
- Computer and Systems Engineering page's 4th year category does not split the courses into semesters
- Sometimes, students have an option to choose one of two courses but the formatting differs from major to major (e.g. CS 4th Year Prog Lang and Design, Innovation, and Society)
