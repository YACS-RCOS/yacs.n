XINFORMATICS,"Informatics covers a broad range of disciplines addressing challenges in the explosion of data and information resources. Xinformatics provides commonality for implementations in specific disciplines, e.g. X=astro, geo. Informatics' theoretical bases are information and computer science, cognitive science, social science, library science, aggregating these studies and adding the practice of information processing, and the engineering of information systems. This course grounds the material that students will learn in discipline areas by coursework and project assignments.",['CSCI-1200'],[],,,,,,,,,,
PRINCIPLES OF PROGRAM ANALYSIS,"The goal of this course is to introduce students to program analysis and its many applications in software engineering, particularly in improving software quality and software productivity. Concretely, students who successfully complete this course should be able to: (1) understand and apply program analysis techniques, such as dataflow analysis and type-based analysis; (2) implement program analysis; (3) understand and apply software testing techniques, such as black-box testing and white-box testing; and (4) understand and apply refactoring techniques.",['CSCI-4430'],[],,,,,,,,,,
DIST COMPUTING OVER INTERNET,"This course will enable students to understand and apply theoretical foundations of programming concurrent, distributed, and mobile computing systems, namely process calculi, actors, join calculus, and mobile ambients. In the practical part, students will compare communication and synchronization aspects in concurrent programming languages following these theoretical models. Students will also review current research on distributed computing over the Internet, on topics including but not limited to coordination, mobility, heterogeneity, security, fault tolerance, scalability, programmability, and verification.","['CSCI-4430', 'CSCI-4210', 'CSCI-4220']",[],,,,,,,,,,
ADVANCED COMPUTER GRAPHICS,"In this course, there will be a survey of classic papers and current research in computer graphics. Topics include: advanced ray tracing, global illumination, photon mapping, subsurface scattering, mesh generation and simplification, subdivision surfaces, volumetric modeling, procedural modeling and texturing, weathering, physical simulation, appearance models. Course activities include programming assignments, oral presentations, and a term project. This is a communication-intensive course.","['CSCI-2300', 'CSCI-2600', 'ECSE-4750']",[],,,,,,,,,,
NUM SOLUTION OF ORDIN DIFF EQ,"Numerical methods and analysis for ODEs with applications from mechanics, optics, and chaotic dynamics. Numerical methods for dynamic systems include Runge-Kutta, multistep and extrapolation techniques, methods for conservative and Hamiltonian systems, methods for stiff differential equations and for differential-algebraic systems. Methods for boundary value problems include shooting and orthogonalization, finite difference and collocation techniques, and special methods for problems with boundary or shock layers.","['MATH-4800', 'CSCI-4800']",[],,,,,,,,,,

PROFESSIONAL PROJECT,"Active participation in a semester-long project, under the supervision of a faculty adviser. A Professional Project often serves as a culminating experience for a Professional Master's program but, with departmental or school approval, can be used to fulfill other program requirements. With approval, students may register for more than one Professional Project. Professional Projects must result in documentation established by each department or school, but are not submitted to the Office of Graduate Education and are not archived in the library. Grades of A, B, C, or F are assigned by the faculty adviser at the end of the semester.

INTERMEDIATE MICROECON THEORY,"This course combines demand, derived from consumer preferences, and supply, based on firms' production functions, to establish market prices for goods and services. Calculus-based techniques are used to minimize costs and maximize utility and profits across differing industry structures. Product pricing strategies are examined. The course also provides an introduction to topics such as the pricing of stocks and bonds, game theory, positive and negative externalities, asymmetric information, and behavioral economics.Applies the microeconomic theory of the firm to price, cost, and output decisions of business enterprises under different market structures.

BIG DATA POLICY,"Although the term 'big data' is relatively new on the scene, the idea of collecting, protecting, and sharing large data sets has been around since before computers were a major player. Similarly, the concept of a 'policy,' high-level guidelines providing a general course of action (or inaction) in a given area, is not new. Putting those two concepts together, however, is a recent phenomenon which has created a set of intriguing challenges. What is 'open data?' What does it mean to 'share' data? Who makes such policies and how are they implemented? Do data policies look the same all over the world? What are the economic, cultural, and technological implications/impacts of/on a given data policy? How would one even go about understanding and evaluating a data policy? This course takes the basics of policy design and analysis, blends in critical thinking skills, ethics, group dynamics, national perspectives, and international perspectives, and applies it all to the world of big data.",[],[],,,,,,,,,,

Students completing the course will gain experience using mathematical tools drawn from diverse fields including calculus, linear algebra, probability theory,  nonlinear optimization, and other closely related disciplines. Rather than providing complete coverage of each field or focusing on formal proofs, the goal will be to provide students with the essential elements necessary to understand and use these tools to solve current and outstanding problems in the field today. This class will be hands-on, using examples drawn from across the cognitive sciences. Students will also gain experience implementing mathematical models in the R programming language.","['PSYC-1200', 'PSYC-4310', 'COGS-2120', 'CSCI-1100']",[],,,,,,,,,,

SUSTAINABILITY BY DESIGN,"Sustainability by Design will center around student-led project-based research, with a focus on getting to know one's own specific potential, leveraging personal connections to communities, and making a difference in larger systems that can often seem intractable. Students will learn how to think and act within whole systems and design solutions that identify and push on leverage points in these systems. This process will bring analysis and design together in a multitude of ways, and the course can be thought of as a hybrid seminar/studio course, where students will learn about many design principles and practices and apply these lessons in practice, forming feedback loops between theory and action. At their best, students will transform systems from a degenerative state, to a sustainable one, and beyond to achieve regenerative systems.",[],[],,,,,,,,,,

Students will learn how to think and act within whole systems and design solutions that identify and push on leverage points in these systems. This process will bring analysis and design together in a multitude of ways, and the course can be thought of as a hybrid seminar/studio course, where students will learn about many design principles and practices and apply these lessons in practice, forming feedback loops between theory and action. At their best, students will transform systems from a degenerative state, to a sustainable one, and beyond to achieve regenerative systems.","['STSS-2300', 'STSS-2210']",[],,,,,,,,,,
