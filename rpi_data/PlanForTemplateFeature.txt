Plan For Feature:

- Add a new tab to hold this feature
- Create a screen to show all the majors seperated by school
- When any major pressed then open template for page:
    template should hold:
        - check boxes for classes that have been taken
        - prerequisites for the given class when clicked
        - if class is optional or required
        - OTHER
- Have some way to categorize the degrees by school since the
  current json doesn't differentiate
-
