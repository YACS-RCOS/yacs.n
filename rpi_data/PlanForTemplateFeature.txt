Plan For Feature:

- Add a new tab to hold this feature
- Create a screen to show all the majors seperated by school
- When any major pressed then open template for page:
    template should hold:
        - check boxes for classes that have been taken
        - prerequisites for the given class when clicked
        - if class is optional or required
        - OTHER
- Have some way to categorize the degrees by school since the
  current json doesn't differentiate
- 

week 10/21- 10/28
  - Figure out how to read through all the templates in the json file
  - fix issues with scanner to edit format of json file
  - figure out how to print out table for all majors sorted out by school
  - Fix blocker that is being hit currently: 
      - Not able to pull data from (COURSES, DepartmentListComponenet) and display in table
  - Try to get something to print on the new tab that we created
