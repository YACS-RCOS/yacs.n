How to test:
1. All tests will be initially written to src/api/tests directory
2. Name your test file as test_<descriptive test name>.py
3. import all fixtures from fixtures.py
4. Fixture dependencies are passed into tests as parameters, use client and upload (upload only if your test depends on test data)
5. Once test cases are written, run scripts/dev-start.sh
6. Navigate to docker desktop and open a client shell for the api container
7. Run pytest -s
