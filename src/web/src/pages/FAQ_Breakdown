Categorize questions: Group the questions into categories based on their 
topic or area of concern. For example, you could have categories such as 
"Getting Started," "Course Search," "Registration," "Schedule Planning," 
"User Account," and "Technical Issues."

Prioritize questions: Determine which questions are the most frequently 
asked or most important for users. Place those questions at the top 
of each category to ensure users can easily find the answers they need.

Format and structure: Organize the FAQ page with headings, subheadings, 
and bullet points to make it easy to navigate and scan. Use formatting 
elements such as bold or italic text to highlight important points or 
keywords.
